Get partition metadata
You can get information about partitioned tables in the following ways:

Use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS view (Preview).
Use the __PARTITIONS_SUMMARY__ meta-table (legacy SQL only).
Getting partition metadata using INFORMATION_SCHEMA views
When you query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS view, the query results contain one row for each partition. For example, the following query lists all of the table partitions in the dataset named mydataset:



SELECT table_name, partition_id, total_rows
FROM `mydataset.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS`
WHERE partition_id IS NOT NULL
